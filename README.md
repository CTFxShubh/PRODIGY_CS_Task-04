# PRODIGY_CS_Task-04
## Simple Keylogger

# Overview

This project is a basic keylogger program written in Python that captures and logs keystrokes from the user's keyboard. The keylogger runs in the background and logs all keypresses into a text file for review later. It demonstrates how keyloggers work but should only be used for ethical purposes with full permission from the owner of the device.

# Features

Saves to a file: The recorded keystrokes are saved in a text file (`keylogs.txt`).
Runs in the background: Once started, the keylogger works in the background, logging all keyboard activities.

Python 3.x

Python library: `pynput`

# Installation
